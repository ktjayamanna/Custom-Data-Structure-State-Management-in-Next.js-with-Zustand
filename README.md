# Custom Data Structure State Management in Next.js with Zustand

This project demonstrates an effective strategy for managing custom data structures—specifically, a stack—within a Next.js application using Zustand for global state management. The goal is to explore and establish the best practices for synchronizing a custom data structure between local component state and global Zustand store, ensuring UI consistency and reactivity.

## Features

- **Custom Stack Data Structure**: Implementation of a classic stack data structure with methods like `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and more.
- **Zustand Store Integration**: Utilizes Zustand for managing the global state of the stack, including a method for syncing the local stack state with the global store.
- **React Hooks for Local State Management**: Demonstrates using React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for handling local state of the stack within components.
- **Efficient State Updates**: Showcases a pattern for ensuring component re-renders when the stack's state changes, leveraging cloning to handle reference-based state updates.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://your-repository-url.git
cd your-project-directory
npm install
```

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system to proceed with running the project.

## Usage

To run the Next.js application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, making the app accessible via `http://localhost:3000`.

### Working with the Stack

The stack is implemented in `dataStructures/stack.js` and is integrated into the application via a Zustand store defined in `store.js`. Components interact with the stack using a local state that is initially synchronized with the global state and provide UI controls to modify the stack.

#### Modifying the Stack

The main component, `DataViewComponent`, allows users to push random data onto the stack and pop the last entry, showcasing the stack's LIFO behavior.
